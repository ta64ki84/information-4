						<h4>Origin of Ssireum</h4>
						<p>Ssireum is an athletic sport that has already started from the ancient era in Korea. There are paintings depicting ssireum in Goguryeo tombs in Manchuria, which are believed to have been built around the 4th century, and Jangcheon No. 1 tomb, which is believed to have been built around the 5th century. Therefore, it is believed that ssireum had already existed before the Three Kingdoms period during Goguryeo. Records of ssireum written in the librarian book can be found in Goryeosa Temple produced during the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty.</p>

				<p>Ssireum is a unique sport to Korea, in which two people hold a loincloth or trousers at the waist and compete for strength and wisdom to knock down the opponent. In ssireum, the player grabs the loincloth wrapped around the opponent's waist and legs, and when the match starts, the first person to touch the ground with any part of the body except the feet loses. It is a game that requires the ability to use the muscles and techniques of the entire body evenly and requires various factors such as agility, muscular strength, mental strength, endurance, and physical strength. In an official game, one referee and two assistant umpires, and the diameter of the playing field should be 8m and level (It should be within 20-10 cm).</p>
				<p>Ssireum was enjoyed by a wide range of people, from the yangban (the gentry of the Joseon Period) to commoners. The changes and developments that were made through social diffusion and being played intensively during certain times of the year, are the unique characteristics of Ssireum, while it has also become a seasonal custom of Korea, played on Dano, Baekjung, and Chuseok.</p>

				<blockquote>Ssireum is a game in which the body and body face off to release strength. The unique charm of Ssireum is that it is designed as a game that anyone can easily participate in by showing creativity with one string. The Satba surrounded by legs and waist permeates the wisdom and wisdom of ancestors who thought hard to exercise their strength and skills to the fullest while excluding possible dangers. Ssireum, which competes for strength with bare bodies, is a fantastic combination of emotional primitives and rationalized modernity. In this respect, it can be said that ssireum implies continuity between modern people and his oldest ancestors. Ssireum can be played with anyone at any time, is always an open space and an old future is clear.</blockquote>
